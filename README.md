Lab work and notes from CodeFellows 401 Java course

# Lab 01: Java primitives and control flow

Three public methods are contained in the file `basics/Main.java`.

## pluralize

The `pluralize` gives a basic example of string formatting with multiple input types, and the use of conditionals.

## flipNHeads

The `flipNHeads` method simulates a random trial where coins are flipped until a certain number of consecutive heads are flipped. It demonstrates the use of `Math.random()`, conditionals, and loops.

## clock

The `clock` method prints the current time to the console every second. This method executes in an infinite loop and only stops when the program is killed (`Ctrl+C`).

# Lab 02: Arrays, Loops, and Testing

The methods were written in the `ArrayLoops` class.

## roll

Our `roll` method takes an `int n` returns an array of `n` die rolls, where each die roll is a random integer from 1 through 6.

## containsDuplicates

The `containsDuplicates` method takes an `int` array as input and returns a boolean indicating whether or not there are any duplicates in the array.

## getAverage

The `getAverage` method takes an `int` array and returns a double with the average value of the array.

## getAverageOfAverages

The `getAverageOfAverages` method takes an array of array of `int`s and returns the average of the average values of each array.
