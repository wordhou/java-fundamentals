# Lab 01: Java primitives and control flow

Three public methods are contained in the file `basics/Main.java`.

## pluralize

The `pluralize` gives a basic example of string formatting with multiple input types, and the use of conditionals.

## flipNHeads

The `flipNHeads` method simulates a random trial where coins are flipped until a certain number of consecutive heads are flipped. It demonstrates the use of `Math.random()`, conditionals, and loops.

## clock

The `clock` method prints the current time to the console every second. This method executes in an infinite loop and only stops when the program is killed (`Ctrl+C`).
