# Lab 02: Arrays, Loops, and Testing

The methods were written in the `ArrayLoops` class.

## containsDuplicates

The `containsDuplicates` method takes an `int` array as input and returns a boolean indicating whether or not there are any duplicates in the array.

## getAverage

The `getAverage` method takes an `int` array and returns a double with the average value of the array. It throws an exception if the input array is empty.

## findLeastAverageArray

The `findLeastAverageArray` method takes an array of array of `int`s and returns the array with the least average value out of all the arrays. It throws if the input array is empty.
